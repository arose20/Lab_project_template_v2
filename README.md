## ⚠️ Template Usage Note

This repository is a **template framework**.

When instantiated for a new project, the following placeholders must be replaced automatically via GitHub Actions:

- `arose20/Lab_project_template_v2` → **current repository slug**
- Workflow badge path (`main.yml`) → adjust if workflow name differs
- Any hardcoded project metadata (if added later via config injection)

This replacement is handled by:

> `.github/workflows/update-readme-badges.yml`

## Overview

This project applies a modular, reproducible computational framework to investigate [INSERT PROJECT GOAL HERE].

It is designed for scalable scientific computing across domains, supporting structured data processing, modelling, and reproducible workflows.

For system design, repository architecture, and execution principles, see:

> **[docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md)**

---

## Scientific Objective

Brief description of the specific scientific or computational objective.

This may include:
- system or process being analysed
- hypotheses or computational tasks
- expected outputs or models

---

## Data Availability

### Input Data

- Primary datasets: [...]
- External datasets: [...]
- Reference datasets: [...]

### Access

- Local/HPC paths: [...]
- Cloud storage: [...]
- Public repositories: [...]

---

## Outputs

All outputs are fully reproducible and stored in `results/`:

- `results/figures/` → visual outputs  
- `results/tables/` → structured results  
- `results/models/` → trained or fitted models  
- `results/embeddings/` → latent representations  
- `results/reports/` → generated summaries  
- `results/exports/` → external data formats  

---

## Reproducibility

A result is reproducible if it can be regenerated from:

- `config/`
- `envs/`
- `data/`
- `src/`
- `workflows/`

No outputs are manually edited.

## Contribution Tracking

This repository currently uses GitHub-based contributor tracking.

### Recommended upgrade

For richer attribution (code, ideas, design, analysis contributions), it is recommended to adopt:

> https://allcontributors.org/en/

This allows:
- categorised contributions (code, docs, ideas, data, review, etc.)
- explicit acknowledgment beyond commits
- better suitability for scientific collaboration
